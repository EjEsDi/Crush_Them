# Crush_Them

### About project:
    Computer Graphics university project done in C/OpenGL/Glut.  
    This project helped in learning about many basic concepts that are being used in Computer Graphics.  
    Such as modeling, rendering, lighting, color models, textures, matrices within graphics, shading, etc.  
    I chose to make game as it is my passion and project it self would be easy to build up on at later times.  

### Game description:
    Goal is to crush as many vehicles as you can.   
    You can crash car by going through it or by shooting a bullet at it.   
    Cars can gain shields. Shields start spawning after you crush 10 cars.   
    If car passes you, it will gain half a shield. First they are half shields, then they turn full color.  
    Crashing into fully visible red shield around car will make you lose game, watch out!
